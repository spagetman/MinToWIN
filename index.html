							<p><strong>Form your own opinion:</strong> 
								<ul>
									<li>The current federal minimum wage hasn't been raised since 2009, while the value of the dollar has decreased by about 25% since then - in other words, the value of the minimum wage has gone down by a quarter as of this year.</li>
									<li>$7.25/hour comes out to only $3,000 above the poverty line for one person, but if children are added into the equation (even with another working adult) the family's income is always below the federal poverty line.</li>
									<li>The current wage doesn't meet the cost of living in <i>any</i> state. A $15 one, while not totally there either, would close that gap by a large amount.</li>
									<li>Many opposers to the new wage say that the cost of products will increase. However, in states that already enact a $15 wage (Colorado, California, D.C.) there has not been a significant change, if at all.</li>
									<li>Raising the wage will give the consumer more buying power, thus stimulating the economy.</li>
									<li>People of all demographics - age, race, and gender - work on the minimum wage; not just younger citizens.</li>
